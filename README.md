## NimGame
# About
Console C++ school project at first (20.11.17 - 09.11.17). 
The school task description specifies that the game NimGame should be programmed in C++ within about 2 months without an NPC and without further instructions. There are no limits to the actual implementation.

The simplest and nevertheless correct solution of the task looks like this:
```Simplest solution (console output)
1: | 
2: | | | 
3: | | | | |
Player A:
From which row would you like to take matches? (1-3)
-> _
....
```
But since this solution would be implemented in 2-4 hours. I see the project as a good opportunity to get started in c++, and will implement the project with the idea of full modularity.
So that I can program other 2d ASCII art games after the NimGame.

In addition, I would like to try to get the most out of the console graphically.
Means here that I use a raster font with the size 0x0, and so I can work directly with single "pixels".

Preview (after first two weeks):

Furthermore, I have planned several opponent settings:
Simple, Normal, Extreme & Learnable.
Learning to learn means in this sense that the opponent gets better with every game played, as he remembers his mistakes. 
In this case, however, the delivery time must still be observed.
